                I like this song because of the instrumentals and lyrics. The guitar riff in the beginning is 
                very instantly recognizeable. The lyrics are about someone being manipulated to think they're insane.

                I found this video in middle school, and would play it for my friends all the time. I've always
                liked Markiplier, so subsequently I like his dog a lot too. It's got nostalgic and funny elements, 
                plus a dog, so what's not to like?
